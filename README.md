# Key Features

- **Text Detection and Extraction**: Detects important text regions in an image using edge detection, bounding boxes, and clustering algorithms. These regions are then passed through an OCR engine to extract the textual content.

- **Efficient Image Processing**: The combination of Canny edge detection, contour extraction, and line attachment helps ensure that all significant parts of the image are detected and processed accurately.

- **Customizable**: Parameters such as the margin for bounding boxes, maximum area for filtering, and clustering epsilon values can be adjusted to improve detection based on specific document structures.

- **Extensible Architecture**: The modular design allows users to extend or modify the existing methods for additional functionality, such as adapting to different document formats or integrating with other OCR systems.

**DISCLAIMER**

   It should be noted that the current directory is a primary version of the project, thus may contains some issues regarding the developpement/programming phase. Therefore, if you encounter any bug, logical or syntaxical error, please be aware of the challenges and difficulties in handling certain image distortions, where text detection might fail due to overlapping or skewed text.


**NOTE -** If in any cirmuctances, you want to get a copy of the experiment into a particular plateform, please make sure to contact the **authors** of the project for further authority.
