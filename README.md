# Main Repositories

- **documentation**: 
The `documentation` directory contains detailed explanations of the project's structure, functionality, and the technical processes behind the implemented modules. It provides step-by-step guides, usage instructions, and insights into the algorithms and methods used within the project. Treated as a theoritical part of the project, this directory, serves as a reference for understanding the overall workflow, making it easier for users and contributors to navigate and utilize the various components of the project efficiently.

- **sources**: 
The `sources` directory contains the raw materials and data utilized throughout the project. This includes images, templates, and any other assets that are essential for testing, processing, and validating the functionality of the implemented algorithms. Treated as a practical part of the project, this directory, serves as a central repository for the inputs required by various modules and their relative outcomes, helping ensure consistency and ease of access for future modifications or expansions.

# Key Features

- **Text Detection and Extraction**: Detects important text regions in an image using edge detection, bounding boxes, and clustering algorithms. These regions are then passed through an OCR engine to extract the textual content.

- **Efficient Image Processing**: The combination of Canny edge detection, contour extraction, and line attachment helps ensure that all significant parts of the image are detected and processed accurately.

- **Customizable**: Parameters such as the margin for bounding boxes, maximum area for filtering, and clustering epsilon values can be adjusted to improve detection based on specific document structures.

- **Extensible Architecture**: The modular design allows users to extend or modify the existing methods for additional functionality, such as adapting to different document formats or integrating with other OCR systems.

**DISCLAIMER**

This repository represents an early version of the project `_Paperless_`. It may consist of several modules related to the overall application, including (but not limited to) the applicant tracking system (ATS). These modules and their corresponding sub-modules are under continuous development. Consequently, some sections or components may undergo significant changes over time, such as being altered, replaced, or added, which may introduce bugs or inconsistencies during the development phase.

The readers are expected to be mindful of potential challenges in this stage. Specifically, the normal behaviour of the workflow is exposed to some programming issues. There might be logical, syntax, or runtime errors due to the complexity of handling certain aspects of the system, where the needed process can fail. If any issues is encountered, please understand the ongoing nature of the development and the associated flexibility.

Your feedback and reports on bugs are highly appreciated to improve the project further.



**NOTE -** If in any cirmuctances, you want to get a copy of the experiment into a particular plateform, please make sure to contact the **authors** of the project for further authority.
